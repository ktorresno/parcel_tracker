# Parcel Tracking App

**Tracking** is the process of gathering and management of information related
to the current location of products or delivery items.

Effective tracking doesn't just improve customer satisfaction; it also empowers
companies with precise Estimated Time of Arrival (**ETA**), ultimately elevating
the overall quality of the service.

The objective of this app is to provide information to the customers about their
packages status across all the delivery process from its order placement until
its arrival to its destiny.

Nowadays, parcels carry bars or QR codes can hold much more information than a
simple package number. The software can record:

- The history of where the parcel has been.
- Its content.
- Weight.
- Dimensions.
- Recipient and destination.
- Required certifications.

Every time the parcel changes hands, an employee from the
delivery company can use a barcode scanner to scan the
package history in the system.

Companies can then make this information accessible to their
customers, who can then track packages as they reach another
destiny. The item will be scanned and updated when it is:

- Loaded for delivery.
- Leaves the courier agency.
- Received by a new agency.
- Sent out for delivery again.

Finally, it arrives at the recipient's location, and the
parcel is scanned for the last time.

## Different types of Delivery Status

| Order processing | The order is being readied for shipment, potentially involving product picking, packing, and labeling. |
| Shipped/Dispatched | The delivery service now has the order, and customers usually receive a tracking number. |
